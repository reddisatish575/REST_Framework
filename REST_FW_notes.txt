what is django ?
--------------------------
-> django is open source and most popular python fw that is used to develop a fast, scalable and secure web applications
-> fw is collection of sw modules and tools to reduce the developing time
-> django provides register and login functionality by default
-> we need to store the passwords in encrypted formates, it will automatically stores the passwordds
	 in PBKDF2 algorithm(password based key derivation function 2) with SHA 256 hashing technique to store the passwords.
-> django comes with default admin panel, we can do almost all types of crud operations without coding
-> highly scalable

why use django ?
------------------
-> clear, simple, reliable, fast, secure, flexible,scalable
-> huge community support and contribuntion
-> youtube, instagram, 
-> built in user admin panel, fully featured web interface automatcally generated
-> we can do easily do crud operations on admin panel
-> django follows DRY principle (don't repeat yourself) principle.  

commands to learn
------------------
1. python3 --version
2. pip3 --version
3. python3 -m venv env
4. pip3 install django
5. python3 -m pip freeze
    -> to check the installed modules and packages
6. django-admin startproject mysite .
	-> used to create django project where last dot will tell to create 
		django project at root level.
7. python3 manage.py runserver
	-> run the project
8. python3 manage.py startapp employees
	-> used to create new app
9. python3 manage.py migrate 
	-> used to create all the required default tables in admin panel
10. python3 manage.py createsuperuser
	-> used to create super user for login to the admin panel
11. python3 -m pip install Pillow
	-> used to install the python module to work with the images in models.py
12. python3 manage.py makemigrations
	-> it will reads the models.py and look for any changes in that.
	-> it will create the migration file and generates the sql commands for migrationfile
13. python3 manage.py migrate
	-> it will create tables and update the tables with latest changes.

django project structure
--------------------------
1. mysite is project directory
2. manage.py
	-> it is command line utility in django projects
	-> t serves as the primary interface for interacting with your Django project and performing various administrative tasks
	-> never edit this file until you are expert
	-> we can use this file to execute so many commands
3. mysite
	1. __init__.py
		-> we can ignore this file, it is empty file while creating project
		-> before we get to know about the purpose of the file, we should know about python packages
		-> package is collection of modules(functions, classes, variables)
		-> Don't delete this file, if we delete , we can't import modules/functions from one package to another package
		-> importing functionality will be easy with this file
	2. wsgi.py
		-> it stands for web server gatewat interface.
		-> it is used for deploying our application in production server(apache or nginx).
		-> it can be thought of as a specification how servers should interact with web applications
	3. asgi.py
		-> it is similar with wsgi.py, it has extra functionalities
		-> it is stands for asynchronous server gateway interface
	4. urls.py
		-> universal resource locater
		-> it can contain end points of webpages, images etc.,
	5. settings.py
		-> it is most important file in django project
		-> it will add the all the configurations for our django project
		-> it will come with some basic settings
		1. BASE_DIR
			-> it will get the root directory dynamically
			-> project name
		2. SECRET_KEY
			-> secret key used to generates the hashes for encrypt the data
		3. DEBUG
			-> it is set as true in development server
			-> in production it will be false
			-> we don't want to show any warning or errors or sample code or urls to the viewers 
		4. ALLOWED_HOSTS
			-> used to allow the devices addresses
		5. INSTALLED_APPS
			-> we should register the apps in this list
		6. MIDDLEWARE
		7. ROOT_URLCONF
			-> it will show urls.py path from the root folder
		8. TEMPLATES
			-> this configuration used to rendering the frontend templates
			-> we will add folder of bundle html templates in the DIR folder
		9. WSGI_APPLICATION
			-> it have server configuration
		10. DATABASES
			-> it have db connections
		11. AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS
			-> builtin password validators, used to check the strength of the passwords
		12. STATIC_URL
			-> image files, css files, js files are static files
		13. DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD
			-> primary key


How Django Works ?
-------------------
-> Django follows MVT Design Pattern
-> Model View Template
-> the design patterns are the way of defining the rules of developing software applications.
-> Model 
	-> it is reponsible for each and every DB operations
	-> it will be in server side
	-> Interact with DB
	-> model is the bridge between view and DB
-> Template
	-> seen by the users
-> View
	-> acts as bridge between modela and template
	-> recieves a request and returns a response
Example:
-> Let rohit requested to check his profile , now url pattern will come to urls.py and 
	in that it will match the requested url in path tuple and execure the corresponding views.method
-> the method will have logic to get the profile details from the DB, view itself cannot connect to the DB directly,
	so it will contact the model, the model will have db related logic
-> the model will give the data to the view and then view will give the data to the template which is seen by user.


URLs and HTTP Responses
-----------------------

BOOTSTRAP INTEGRATION
---------------------


DJANGO STATIC FILES
-------------------
-> if we have multiple folders in that static folder, we have one command called 'collectStatic', it will collect all the folders and place in the static_root. it mainly used in while deployment.

DJANGO APPS
-----------
-> it is python package specifically meant for using in a django project
-> python3 manage.py startapp employees
	-> used to create new app
-> In django project we will have multiple apps
-> app directory structure
	1. __init__.py
		-> if we see this, it means it is not simple folder, it is python packaage
		-> don't delete this file
	2. admin.py
		-> used to register the models in the django admin panel
		-> we can customize this
	3. apps.py
		-> this file is created to help the user to add application leve config
		-> you should have entire django idea then only , you can edit this file
	4. models.py
		-> contains essentials fields and behaviours of the data that storing in the db.
		-> we will create DB tables and class by writing the models in this file.
	5. tests.py
		-> used to run any test in the project
	6. views.py
		-> we will write our bussiness logic in this file
->we will add the app name in the INSTALLED_APPS of settings.py

DJANGO ADMIN PANEL
------------------
-> to access the admin panel, we need to create a superuser by stopping the server and running the command
	'python3 manage.py createsuperuser'

DJANGO MODEL
------------
-> we will create all columns in the models.py file

MIGRATIONS
----------
-> we need to migrate the all the models.py changes to sqllite3 by migrating
-> pillow is the module to work with the images in django project
	-> 'python3 -m pip install Pillow' used to install pillow module
-> python3 manage.py makemigrations
	-> it will reads the models.py and look for any changes in that.
	-> it will create the migration file and generates the sql commands for migrationfile
	-> it won't create any tables, it will generates required file from the models.py changes 
-> python3 manage.py migrate
	-> it will create tables and update the tables with latest changes.
-> we need to register the model in the admin.py then only table will be reflected.

DJANGO MEDIA FILES
------------------
-> to load the uploaded images in the browser, we need to add configuration.
-> we need to add media configuration.

================================================================================================

DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK
----------------------

What is an API ? 
-----------------
-> Application Programming Interface
-> It acts as a two-way communication bridge between fronted and backend

what is REST API ?
-------------------
-> REST stands for Representational State Transfer
-> It Organizes how web applications talk to each other, separating what the user sees(frontend) from 
    what runs behind the scenes(backend).
-> Core Principles of REST API
    1. Stateless
        -> The server doesn't store any info about the client between requests.
    2. Client-Server Architecture
        -> The app (client) ask for things (data) and the server does what's requested(send data or make changes)
    3. Standardized Interface   
        -> REST APIs rely on a set of standard methods (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) for interacting with resources.
    4. Easy-to-Read Data 
        -> REST APIs returns the response in a Standardized easy to read formats(JSON or XML)

REST FRAMEWORK installation
-----------------------------
pip3 install djangorestframework

End Points 
-----------
-> We have two types of endpoints
    1. Web End Points
        -> used to access the web interface from the browser address bar
        -> No need of passing token to this endpoint
    2. API End Points
        -> used to communicate with backend from the application 
        -> need to pass token to get the data 
        -> returns the data to intergate into the fronted 

Create Model
------------
-> whenever we do changes in models.py, we should do both makemigrations and migrate.

Serialization
--------------------
-> to fetch the data from the DB, we use this Serialization.
-> when we try to get the json data by using api endpoint from sqllite3 db by following code 
	 'students = Student.objects.all()'
	 -> we will get 'In order to allow non-dict objects to be serialized set the safe parameter to False' error,
	 	so we should use 'safe=False' parameter inside 	'JsonResponse' method 
	-> after using 'safe=False' in 'JsonResponse', it will convert to querset,  we will get another error like follows 
		'Object of type QuerySet is not JSON serializable'
		so we need serialize this to the json.
	-> we need to use 'safe=False' for all the data types except json or dict.
	-> we can do Serialization in two ways
		1. Manual
			-> by converting the querset to other data types except json is not recommadble
		    -> students = list(students.values()) // Convert QuerySet to list of dicts
		2. By using REST Fw serializers component.
			-> Serialization is process of convering the model object or QuerySet to into json format or
				 any other format that client requires
			-> serializers are like translators for your data.
			-> Deserialization is process of converting the json data to queryset or model objects.
			-> For Serialization we will create one file and do the process. 
			-> use 'many=True' while getting the many objects data.

Class-Based views
-----------------
-> more structured and organized way to handle the requests using OOPS Principles
-> No of Lines of code will be significantly reduced by using this.
-> unlike Function-Based views, these are not straight forward
-> they must inherit 'APIView'.

Mixins
------
-> Mixins are reusable code classes in OOPs that provide specific functionalities.
-> used to add common functionalities to views
-> even though we use mixins, we still have lot of code 
-> We have 5 different types of mixins, we need to extend these mixins to apply
	1. ListModelMixin
		-> supports for returns the list of objects automatcally.
		-> it have list() builtin method 
	2. CreateModelMixin
		-> it will automatcally creates a new object in the DB using it's builtin method 'create()'
	3. RetrieveModelMixin
		-> it will give you support for retrieving single object using it's built-in method 'retireve()'
	4. UpdateModelMixin
		-> it will update the existing data by using primary key using it's builtin method 'update()'
	5. DestroyModelMixin
		-> it will delete the object by using the primary by it's builtin method 'destroy()'
-> we inherit mexins in class based views and we will use generics api view.
-> GenericAPIView
	-> acts as a foundational class for building most API views, 
	-> it provides essential functionalities for handling incoming HTTP Requests (get,post,put,delete).
	-> also formats the outgoing responses in a structured way.

Generics
--------
-> no of lines of code will be reduced.
-> like mixins, generics also provide builtin methods to perform.
-> We have 5 different types of Generics, we need to extend these Generics to apply
	1. ListAPIView
		-> for listing the objects
	2. CreateAPIView
		-> for creating the objects
	3. RetrieveAPIView
		-> for retrieving a single object using primary key 
	4. UpdateAPIView
		-> for updating a single object using primary key 
	5. DestroyAPIView
		-> for deleting a single object using primary key 
	6. ListCreateAPIView
		-> for listing and creating the objects
	7. RetrieveUpdateAPIView
		-> for retrieving and updating the objects using primary key 
	8. RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
		-> for retrieving, updating and deleting the objects using primary key
